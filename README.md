# GeneApp

This is a SpringMVC application that can use AncestryDNA data to check whether two parents are at risk of transmitting Cystic Fibrosis, Sickle Cell Anemia, Hemochromatosis, and Tay Sachs.

Nucleotide values are extracted from the exported AncestryDNA text files and stored in a HashMap with the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as keys. A list of SNPs for each disorder is checked for corresponding risk alleles in the HashMap.

AncestryDNA accuracy varies greatly, and this repository is only for educational purposes.
